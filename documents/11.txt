Information retrieval is the process of finding relevant information from a large repository, such as a database, library, or the internet. It plays a critical role in search engines, enabling users to retrieve documents that match their queries. Techniques like keyword matching, natural language processing, and ranking algorithms are central to information retrieval systems. As data continues to grow exponentially, the field faces challenges in handling vast datasets efficiently while maintaining high accuracy and speed in query responses.
