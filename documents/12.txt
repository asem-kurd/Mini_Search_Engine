The Internet of Things (IoT) connects physical devices like appliances, vehicles, and wearables to the internet, allowing them to collect and exchange data. This interconnected network enables smarter homes, efficient industrial processes, and advanced healthcare solutions. However, IoT also raises concerns about data security and privacy, as connected devices can become potential targets for cyberattacks.
