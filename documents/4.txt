Blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that records transactions in a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof manner. Originally designed for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain has expanded to other areas, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and healthcare records. The technology relies on cryptographic principles to ensure data integrity and uses consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work and proof-of-stake to validate transactions. Blockchain's potential to eliminate intermediaries and enhance trust makes it a game-changer for industries worldwide.
