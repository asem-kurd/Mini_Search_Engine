Big Data refers to extremely large datasets that traditional methods cannot process effectively. These datasets come from various sources, such as social media, sensors, and online transactions. Big Data analytics involves storing, processing, and analyzing this data to uncover patterns and insights. Tools like Hadoop and Spark are commonly used to manage Big Data, which is vital for decision-making in fields like marketing, healthcare, and finance.
