Processors, commonly known as central processing units (CPUs), serve as the brain of computers. They are responsible for executing instructions, performing calculations, and running programs. Modern processors consist of billions of transistors and utilize multiple cores to handle parallel processing, significantly enhancing performance. CPUs are essential not only in personal computers but also in smartphones, gaming consoles, and data centers. Advances in processor technology, such as quantum computing and AI acceleration, are pushing the boundaries of computational capabilities.
