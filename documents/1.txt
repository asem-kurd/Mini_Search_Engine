Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the creation of intelligent machines that can perform tasks typically requiring human cognition, such as problem-solving, learning, and understanding language. AI systems are built on algorithms that allow them to improve with experience, a feature known as machine learning. AI is used in applications ranging from personal assistants like Siri and Alexa to autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis systems. While AI promises to revolutionize many industries, it also raises ethical concerns regarding job displacement, privacy, and decision-making transparency.
