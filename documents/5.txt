Cloud computing revolutionizes the way businesses and individuals access and use computing resources. Instead of relying on local servers or personal devices, users can access storage, processing power, and applications over the internet. Cloud computing offers several models, including Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). Companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud dominate the market, providing scalable and cost-effective solutions. The technology is pivotal for industries like healthcare, where secure and accessible data storage is crucial.
