Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field at the intersection of linguistics and artificial intelligence that allows machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Applications of NLP include chatbots, language translation tools, and sentiment analysis. The technology uses techniques like tokenization, stemming, and neural networks to analyze text and speech. One of its significant achievements is the development of large language models like GPT, which can generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
