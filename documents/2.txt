Augmented Reality (AR) overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing users' perception of their environment. AR applications range from entertainment, such as mobile games like Pok√©mon GO, to practical uses like navigation and interior design. AR relies on technologies like cameras, sensors, and software algorithms to detect and display virtual objects in real-time. It is also gaining traction in education and healthcare, enabling immersive learning experiences and aiding in surgical procedures.
