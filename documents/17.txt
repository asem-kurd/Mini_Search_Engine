Quantum computing leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations far beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Unlike classical bits, which represent data as 0s and 1s, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. This allows quantum computers to solve complex problems, such as drug discovery and cryptographic analysis, exponentially faster. However, the technology is still in its early stages, with challenges like qubit stability and error correction to overcome.
